,parking_config,created by run_feasibility(),string,"parking type, e.g. deck, surface"
,building_sqft,created by run_feasibility(),float,The number of square feet for the building to build. Keep in mind this includes parking and common space. Will need a helpful function to convert from gross square feet to actual usable square feet in residential units.
,building_cost,created by run_feasibility(),float,The cost of constructing the building as given by the ave_cost_per_sqft from the cost model (for this FAR) and the number of square feet.

,total_cost,created by run_feasibility(),float,The cost of constructing the building plus the cost of acquisition of the current parcel/building.
,building_revenue,created by run_feasibility(),float,"The NPV of the revenue for the building to be built, which is the number of square feet times the yearly rent divided by the cap rate (with a few adjustment factors including building efficiency)."
,max_profit_far,created by run_feasibility(),float,The FAR of the maximum profit building (constrained by the max_far and max_height from the input dataframe).
,max_profit,created by run_feasibility(),float,The profit for the maximum profit building (constrained by the max_far and max_height from the input dataframe).
