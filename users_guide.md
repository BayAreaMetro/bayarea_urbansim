## Output Files
Each Bay Area UrbanSim run (r#) produces output files. Some are only output at the start and/or finish of the run, but most are produced every in each 5th year of the run (yr).
* run[r#].log shows livetime run progress which includes info on scenario numbers, inputs, model execution, and performance
* run[r#]\_superdistrict_summaries\_[yr].csv contain a summary of select variables at the Super District level (n=33)
* run[r#]\_juris_summaries\_[yr].csv contain a summary of select variables at the juridictional level (n=108)
* run[r#]\_taz_summaries\_[yr].csv contain a summary of select variables at the Travel Analysis Zone level (n=1454)
* run[r#]\_baseyear\_pda_summaries\_2010.csv contain a summary at the PDA level for the START of 2010 (the other 2020 summary occurs at the end of the year 2010 and so contains one year of model forecast)
