## Base Year GeoDatabase
The basemap is a geodatabase containing the region's parcels, buildings, households, and jobs in the baseyear (2015 for PBA50). It is built in two major stages:
1. The assembly and cleaning of raw dataset. This is done through manual data cleaning in excel and python scripts in ArcGIS Pro and is described at https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/petrale/edit/master/basemap/basemap_assembly_steps.md
2. Imputation of missing data to fill missing values and conform to regional totals. This is done by running BAUS in preprocessing mode.

### Preprocessing
BAUS's [preprocessing](https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/bayarea_urbansim/blob/master/baus/preprocessing.py) steps take raw input data and ready it for use in forecasting. This step only needs to be run once on a given instance of the base year data until something is changed. 


* Table Modifications
The input tables are transformed in the process below into new versions with "preproc" appended to the names:
* parcels.csv becomes parcels_
* buildings
* households.csv becomes households_preproc.csv with the following changes:
1. 

tenure
unittype
unit_num
unit_id
* jobs.csv becomes jobs_preproc.csv with 
1. empsix 
2. building_id



* Fill In Missing Values Using xxxx







* [Match Aggregate]((https://github.com/MetropolitanTransportationCommission/bayarea_urbansim/blob/master/data_regeneration/match_aggregate.py))

TAZ as local control for both res and comm

 [Allocate Demand Agents to Buuldings](https://github.com/MetropolitanTransportationCommission/bayarea_urbansim/blob/master/data_regeneration/demand_agent_allocation.py)

allocate jobs from TAZ to building




* Perform Quality Control Summaries

* Export Integrated Parcels
The [export_to_h5](https://github.com/MetropolitanTransportationCommission/bayarea_urbansim/blob/master/data_regeneration/export_to_h5.py) script:

* [maps](https://github.com/MetropolitanTransportationCommission/bayarea_urbansim/blob/master/data_regeneration/export_to_h5.py#L15-L31) development_type_id to building_type_id

* sets the h5 [path](https://github.com/MetropolitanTransportationCommission/bayarea_urbansim/blob/master/data_regeneration/export_to_h5.py#L13)

* [stores](https://github.com/MetropolitanTransportationCommission/bayarea_urbansim/blob/master/data_regeneration/export_to_h5.py#L60-L67) the tables in the hdf5

* among other things 



# Existing Planned Land Use
By deafult, BAUS assumes that local jurisdictions' regulations and what type and how much development can occur on a given parcel constrain development activity. This data is usually a jurisdiction's zoning but sometimes represent general plan or other modified capacity data. This information is provided by using two lookup tables:
* [2015_12_21_zoning_parcels.csv](https://mtcdrive.box.com/s/ir65mdbytf2lpjx8i41j7lpxqm4r1ujm) is stored on Box because of its size. This file links each parcel to its zoning_type_id.
* [zoning_lookup.csv](https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/bayarea_urbansim/blob/master/data/zoning_lookup.csv) joins with the file above using _id_ and provides the contraints for each zoning_type. Maximum allowable intensity is provide by max_far (Floor Area Ratio) for commercial development and by max_dua (Dwelling Units per Acre). _max_height_ constrains either type of development when it in not NULL. The 14 two-letter variables are dummy variable denoting whether each of these building types can be built in this zoning_type.

# Scenario Planned Land Use
BAUS is usually run using scenario-based inputs. These represent various potential changes to urban constraints and policies. Even "baseline" or No Project run generally use Scenario 0 which implements existing UGBs and a few minor adjustments to the basic planned land use information. The modifications to planned land use for a given scenario are not implemented within the existing planned land typology. Instead, two files contain these modfification relatiomnshiops:
* In parcels.csv inside [2015_09_01_v3.h5](https://mtcdrive.box.com/s/bo4u2dd6ed7k5bpwl2gnfc36lrxop791) each parcel is assigned to zoning modification category (zoningmodcat). These are the union of various zones of interest and each combination can have unique policies applied to it. The code is a concatenation of zone types and has changed through various applications:
 * In PBA50 we want to join on pba50zoningmodcat which is built using !juris_id! + !gg_id! + !tra_id! + !sesit_id! + !ppa_id! + !exp2020_id! + !exsfd_id!
* Each scenario-specific modfication table (e.g., for Scenario 4 see [zoning_mods_4.csv](https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/bayarea_urbansim/blob/master/data/zoning_mods_4.csv)) contains modifcations to the existing zoning including up/down-zoning and the addition/subtraction of allowed uses. If nothing is noted in a row, existing planned land use is retained in this scenario. Modifications are of various types:
* Changing the Planned Land Use to allow more/less development intensity or additional/fewer building types. This is used to upzone and allow multi-family residential in many growth areas; and to upzone and limit growth to industrial in PPAs.
* Implement the UGB. Disallow growth outside existing UGBs or outside city limits when a city has no UGB.
* Change areas within UGBs that have not zoning to typical suburban zoning for each county.
* In scenarios that assume the UGBs expand, some areas are changed to typical suburban zoning for that county.





# Other Urban Policies
Most urban policies beyond changes to planned land use are established in [policy.yaml](https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/bayarea_urbansim/blob/master/configs/policy.yaml), sometimes using data from a table in /data. For instance, inclusionary zoning is set up at https://github.com/BayAreaMetro/bayarea_urbansim/blob/4166c25a798f2b8d045546e5b6cef45a5ca9fa4c/configs/policy.yaml#L143,
