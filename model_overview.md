## Introduction
Bay Area UrbanSim (BAUS) is a land use or urban economic model used to study urban policy and transportation projects at the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC). It 

## Approach
BAUS is used to forecast the future by stepping through repeated steps that chart out a potential pathway for future urban growth. The model is run from a file called baus.py that 

## Model System
BAUS is the middle model in an interactive suite of three model systems maintained by MTC:
* Regional economic and demographic information is supplied to BAUS from the REMI CGE model and related demographic processing scripts. BAUS outputs on housing production are used to adjust regional housing prices (and thus other variables) in REMI. 
* Accessibillity information is supplied to BAUS from the Travel Model and influences real estate prices and household and employee location choices. BAUS outputs on the location of various types of households and employees are used to establish origins and destinations in the Travel Model.
