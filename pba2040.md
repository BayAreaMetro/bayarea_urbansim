## Scenario 0 (the No Project)

* [zoning_mods_0](https://github.com/MetropolitanTransportationCommission/bayarea_urbansim/blob/master/data/zoning_mods_0.csv) expands suburban area by 389 sq miles (ubz, ubz_np, exp0, exp0_np, exp1, exp1_np, and exp2_np are upzoned)
* keeps existing 2010 jurisdictional development caps
* second units allowed in jurisdictions that allow in 2010 (not implemented yet)
* residential parking minimums as in 2010
* SB743: To represent the EIR move from LOS to VMT, we want to do a slight "subsidy" in efficient VMT locations and a slight penalty in inefficient ones. Can we do %? Or we could translate into something like the VMT fee with absolute amounts. If % possible try as in SB743 Profitability Modification Table below
* builds projects where scen0=1 in [Development Projects](https://github.com/MetropolitanTransportationCommission/bayarea_urbansim/blob/master/data/development_projects.csv). These are 1) projects built between 2010 and 2015, and 2) large institutional projects started by 2015
* committed transportation network/policies

## Scenario 1

* [zoning_mods_1](https://github.com/MetropolitanTransportationCommission/bayarea_urbansim/blob/master/data/zoning_mods_au.csv) upzones select suburban centers (res and com) and expands UGBs "faster than expected compared to past trends" so expands suburban area by 565 sq miles  (ubz, exp0, exp1, exp3_au, and expmaz(79sqmi) are upzoned while avoiding PCAs)
* keeps existing 2010 jurisdictional development caps
* second units allowed in all jurisdictions (not implemented yet)
* residential parking minimums decreased in PDAs along rail
* SB743 as in scen0
* OBAG: In 2010 one account is set up for the entire region. Each year $200m is added to the account. In a given year, whatever is in the account is available to subsidize housing construction within any PDA in the region.
* inclusionary housing policy in jurisdictions with at least one PDA that taxes new housing construction to subsidize affordable housing construction within that jurisdiction.
* vmt_fee_com assesses fees on office and retail construction in zones where employees have high average commute lengths. Zones are classified according to the variable nonres_cat in [vmt_fee_zonecats.csv](https://github.com/MetropolitanTransportationCommission/bayarea_urbansim/blob/master/data/vmt_fee_zonecats.csv).
* builds projects where scen1=1 in [Development Projects](https://github.com/MetropolitanTransportationCommission/bayarea_urbansim/blob/master/data/development_projects.csv). These are 1) projects built between 2010 and 2015, and 2) large institutional projects started by 2015
* scenario 1 network/policies


## Scenario 2

* [zoning_mods_2](https://github.com/MetropolitanTransportationCommission/bayarea_urbansim/blob/master/data/zoning_mods_2.csv) upzones PDAs to match their place type and assumes 2010 UGBs hold (existing true UGB/ULL and city boundaries where no limit) (ubz only while avoiding PCAs) so 68 additional sq miles
* keeps existing 2010 jurisdictional development caps except raises SF office cap to 1.5m annually
* second units along all jurisdictions along El Camino Real and East Bay Corridors (not implemented yet)
* residential parking minimums decreased in PDAs that have high levels of transit access along El Camino Real and East Bay Corridors
* SB743 as in scen0
* OBAG as in scen1
* inclusionary housing policy in jurisdictions with at least one PDA that taxes new housing construction to subsidize affordable housing construction within that jurisdiction. 
* builds projects where scen2=1 in [Development Projects](https://github.com/MetropolitanTransportationCommission/bayarea_urbansim/blob/master/data/development_projects.csv). These are 1) projects built between 2010 and 2015, and 2) large institutional projects started by 2015 
* scenario 2 network/policies


## Scenario 3

* [zoning_mods_3](https://github.com/MetropolitanTransportationCommission/bayarea_urbansim/blob/master/data/zoning_mods_3.csv) upzones areas with high transit access (with an emphasis on the Big 3 and their neighbors) and tightens UGBs to city boundaries
* keeps existing 2010 jurisdictional development caps except drops SF office cap
* second units allowed in Big 3 cities (not implemented yet)
* residential parking minimums decreased in Big 3 cities and neighboring high transit cities 
* SB743 as in scen0
* OBAG as in scen1
* inclusionary housing policy in Big 3 Cities that taxes new housing construction to subsidize affordable housing construction within that jurisdiction.
* tax policy: land value tax in Big 3
* vmt_fee_res assesses fees on residential construction in zones with households with high average commute lengths. Zones are classified according to the variable res_cat in [vmt_fee_zonecats.csv](https://github.com/MetropolitanTransportationCommission/bayarea_urbansim/blob/master/data/vmt_fee_zonecats.csv).
* builds projects where scen3=1 in [Development Projects](https://github.com/MetropolitanTransportationCommission/bayarea_urbansim/blob/master/data/development_projects.csv). These are 1) projects built between 2010 and 2015, and 2) large institutional projects started by 2015, and 3) very large mixed-use projects that have been designed and assessed for feasibility using spreadsheet pro formas 
* scenario 3 network/policies


## Scenario 4 (the Preferred Plan)
* [zoning_mods_4](https://github.com/MetropolitanTransportationCommission/bayarea_urbansim/blob/master/data/zoning_mods_4.csv) upzones PDAs to match their place type and assumes 2010 UGBs hold (existing true UGB/ULL and city boundaries where no limit) (ubz only while avoiding PCAs) so 68 additional sq miles
* keeps existing 2010 jurisdictional development caps except raises SF office cap to 1.5m annually
* second units along all jurisdictions along El Camino Real and East Bay Corridors (not implemented yet)
* residential parking minimums decreased in PDAs that have high levels of transit access along El Camino Real and East Bay Corridors
* SB743 as in scen0
* OBAG as in scen1
* inclusionary housing policy in jurisdictions with at least one PDA that taxes new housing construction to subsidize affordable housing construction within that jurisdiction.

## SB743
(Modification, Applied regionwide by TAZ) This refelcts the expected shift in CEQA transporation analysis requirements from emphasising LOS to emphasizing VMT. Project profitabilility shifts as in the table below.

### SB743 Profitability Modification Table
| vmt_cat (res or non_res) | profitability shift |
|--------------------------|---------------------|
| VH                       | -2%                 |
| H                        | -1%                 |
| MH                       | -0.5%               |
| M                        | 0                   |
| S                        | +2%                 |


## OBAG 
(Account, Applied to all PDAs) $160 million per year is spent on projects within the PDAs. Although this funds planning and infrastructure projects, we treat it here as a direct subsidy as if the developer received an equivalent amount of money to build a project.


## CEQA Tiering 
(Modification, Applied to all TPAs)
Make any sort of development in a TPA 1% more profitable


## Parcel Tax
(Account, Applied to all PDAs, Deed-Restricted)
$24 annual parcel tax throughout region into fund for affordable housing
so $42,000,000 is placed in an account annually to be spent on affordable housing in any PDA in the region 


## Housing Capital Gains Tax
(Account, Applied to all PDAs, Deed-Restricted)
$500,000,000 is placed in an account annually to be spent on affordable hosuing in any PDA in the region


## No Parking Minimums  
(Modification, Applied to PDAs in 1 and 2, TPAs in 3)
Make projects 1% more profitable in zone above. (Or is there a better proxy from the parking work? or other research?)

## Inclusionary Zoning High
(Account, Applied to Big 3 Cities and Neighbors, Deed-Restricted)
Sets a relatively high level of inclusionary units requried with the proportion required in each jurisdiction listed here:
###inclusionary_housing_high

| juris         | prop |
|---------------|------|
| San Francisco | 0.2  |
| Oakland       | 0.2  |
| San Jose      | 0.2  |


## VMT Fees
(Account, Applied regionally by TAZ, Deed-Restricted)

The fees in the table below are assessed on development in zones with higher VMT (home-end of commute for res; work-end of commmute for commercial. Res assessed on any type of residential development; commercial only for office and retail. Money available regionally to subsidize housing construction in PDAs. Susidized units are deed-restricted.

### VMT Fees by Zone Category Table

| Category| Residential VMT Fee Action          |Commercial VMT Fee Action             |
|---------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| VH      | assess res dev fee $25,000 per HU   | assess com dev fee $50 per OF/RS sqft|
| H       | assess res dev fee $15,000 per HU   | assess com dev fee $30 per OF/RS sqft|
| MH      | assess res dev fee $5,000 per HU    | assess com dev fee $20 per OF/RS sqft|
| M       | nothing                             | assess com dev fee $6 per OF/RS sqft |
| PDA     | money available to subsidize units  | money available to subsidize res units|
 
 
## Land Value Tax
(Modification, Applied to Big 3 cities)
In the Big 3 cities, represent approximate impacts of switching from the current property tax system to one which achieves the same income but only from taxing the value of the land value (and not the structure value). Could we approach this: every so many more percent lower the improvement-to-land ratio is, profitability on a new structure rises some percent? For now lets try assuming an acre of land is worth $33.3m in SF, $7.8m in San Jose, and $5.4m in Oakland and apply these changes to land zoned for HM:

| ILR     | Residential Profitability Change    |Commercial Profitablity Change        |
|---------|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| > 0.5    | no change                           | no change                            |
| 0.5-0.3 | 1%                                  | 1%                                   |
| 0.3-0.1 | 2%                                  | 2%                                   |
| < 0.1    | 5%                                  | 5%                                   |

# Model Output

# Performance Targets

## 4) Direct all non-agricultural development within the urban footprint (existing urban development and UGBs)


## 5) Decrease the share of lower-income residents’ household income consumed by transportation and housing by 10%


## 6) Increase the share of affordable housing in PDAs, TPAs, or high-opportunity areas by 15%


## 7) Do not increase the share of low- and moderate-income renter households in PDAs, TPAs, or high-opportunity areas that are at risk of displacement
