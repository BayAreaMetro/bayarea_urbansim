This is a detailed geodatabase containing all of the region\u2019s buildings, households, employees, policies, and transport network for a recent year. This roughly corresponds to tooday\u2019s conditions but is a few years in the past due to data collection lag and formalities related to the modeling framework. The buildings are largely an accurate collection of every structure gathered from assessor\u2019s data, commercial read estate databases, and other sources. The households and employees are represented at the micro level but their characteristics are built through synthesis (i.e., we only have samples of this informations so we build a full representation that is consistent with these samples). Policies such as zoning and growth limits are collected for each jurisdiction and are binding unless they are explicitly changed for a forecast. BAUS is used to forecast the future by advancing through repeated steps that chart out a potential pathway for future urban growth. In BAUS each step represents a five year period. Most steps repeat the same set of sub-steps. In UrbanSim, each of these sub-steps is called a \u201cmodel\u201d. The file used to run BAUS (baus.py) sets the number steps and the order in which the models are are run. The major types of model steps are: (Hazards): This optional model simulates the impact of earthquakes and sea level rise by destroying buildings and displacing their inhabitants. Calculate accessibility: Logsum accessibility measures are brought in from the Travel Model and pedestrian accessibility is calculated within UrbanSim Calculate housing prices and rents: Hedonic regression models are applied to current (to the model time step) conditions to reestimate current prices and rents HH/employee relcation and transition: Some households and employeees are selected to move; additiional households and employees are added or subtracted to reflect the exogenous control totals Add buildings from the Development Projects list: Buildings are forced into the model (as opposed to being explicitly modeled); these represent institutional plans (e.g., universities and hospitals), large approved projects (e.g., Treasure Island), and development that has occurred between the basemap year and the current year (i.e., constructed 2016-2020). Build new market-rate housing units and commercial space: The for-profit real estate development process is simulated and new buildings are built where they are most feasible; this also build deed-restricted unit that are produced through the market-rate process (e.g., inclusionary zoning). Build new deed-restricted affordable units: A similar not-for-profit real estate development process produces affordable housing units based on money available within BAUS Accounts (e.g., bond measures). HH/employee location choices: Households and employees are assigned to new locations based on logistic regresssion models that capture the preferences of particular segments (e.g., lower income households, retail jobs). Produce summary tables: Numerous zonal summaries of the detailed geodatabaase are produced for analysis of urban change and for use in the Travel Model; this step includes additional post-processing to get the data ready for the Travel Model\u2019s population synthesizer. Sub-Models Typically, a set of BAUS inputs or assumptions are modified to produce a scenario. Policies such as zoning or fees can be modified. Control totals can be adjusted. Assumptions about preferences or financical situations can be adjusted. The package of changes is then simulated to forecast its impact on the future urban landscape and these outcomes are often enterered into the travel model to predict future year travel patterns and greenhouse gas emmissions. Application Types BAUS is used for for three typical types of application: Forecasting: UrbanSim produces a complete map for each five year interval into the future. This information is required by statute and useful for planning processes. Policy Studies: BAUS can evaluate the impact of policy changes on, for example, the amount of housing produced, the amount of deed-restricted housing producded, and the locations of future residential or commercial development. Transport Project Evaluation: BAUS provides information on future land use patterns used to evaluate the benefits and costs of large transport infrastructure investments and allows an assessment of how such projects may influence future development. Model System BAUS is the middle model in an interactive suite of three model systems maintained by MTC: Regional economic and demographic information is supplied to BAUS from the REMI CGE model and related demographic processing scripts. BAUS outputs on housing production are used to adjust regional housing prices (and thus other variables) in REMI. Accessibillity information is supplied to BAUS from the Travel Model and influences real estate prices and household and employee location choices. BAUS outputs on the location of various types of households and employees are used to establish origins and destinations in the Travel Model.","title":"Model Overview"},{"location":"model_overview/#model-overview","text":"","title":"Model Overview"},{"location":"model_overview/#approach","text":"A forecast with BAUS begins with a basemap.

As of Final Blueprint, those sources are: DR = base year DR + pipeline DR + public lands (added via pipeline) + subsidized (production) + preserved + inclusionary Pipeline units cannot be redeveloped, other deed-restricted units can if or when the building is more than 20 years old. In the household location choice models, only Q1 households can enter DR units. However, if the model can't find enough Q1 households for the DR units (due to modeling reasons or over-supply) non-Q1 households are able to enter. Affordable Housing Fund- Preservation (Final Blueprint) Selects buildings to spend preservation funding on, by marking them as deed restricted units. The selection is not tied to price, and housing cost is calculated off model. The buildings are randomly selected based on the total number of buildings to preserve within a geography which are set here . The \"deed restricted\" column is updated in the residential units table, which is used to filter units in the household location choice models and assign Q1 households to deed restricted units. The \"deed restricted units\" and \"preserved units\" columns are updated in the buildings table. These occur here . In some cases, a Q1 household will already occupy a newly preserved unit. If that household moves, only another Q1 will be able to move in. In other cases, a non-Q1 household will occupy a newly preserved unit, and a Q1 household is only able to enter if and when that household moves out. Inclusionary Zoning (Draft Blueprint, Final Blueprint) Inclusionary zoning requirement (x% of new housing development have to be affordable) is set in policy.yalm . The default setting represents the existing requirements without plan strategy interventions. Plan strategies are organized by scenario, with a scenario handler at the top. Inclusionary rate is set at certain geographic level: PBA40 and Horizon: inclusionary percentage by jurisdiction . Draft Blueprint: inclusionary percentage by pba50chcat (i.e. the combination of several growth geography strategies, GG, TRA, PPA, etc.). Final Blueprint: inclusionary percentage by fbpchcat . Coding notes: datasources.py reads inclusionary strategy input and maps it to parcels using the corresponding field: PBA40 and Horizon uses 'jurisdiction' , Draft Blueprint uses 'pba50chcat' , Final Blueprint uses 'fbpchcat'. In subsidies.py , the inclusionary_housing_revenue_reduction function calculates median household AMI , feasible new affordable housing count and revenue_reduction amount of each inclusionary geography. In PBA40 and Horizon, these calculations were conducted at the jurisdiction level. PBA50 uses strategy geographies instead - 'pba50chcat' in Draft Blueprint and 'fbpchcat' in Final Blueprint. The inclusionary statements in summaries.py should be consistent with the inclusionary geography of each plan scenario. Reduce cost for housing development (Draft Blueprint, Final Blueprint) One way to (indirectly) subsidize housing is to reduce housing development cost reduction, for example, SB743 CEQA reform, lowering parking requirements, etc. This is defined in profitability_adjustment_policies . The policies are scenario-based, as noted by \"enable_in_scenarios\". For each policy, profitabiity_adjustment_formula picks the parcels in a certain category (e.g. a certain type of geography) and then decreases the required profitability level needed for the model to build on those parcels, e.g. multiplying by 2.5% or 0.025 means to LOWER the required profit level by 2.5%. When a policy has an alternative version is different scenarios, may use 'alternative_geography_scenarios' and 'alternative_adjustment_formula' to consolidate the scenarios. \"Summaries.py\" summaries these policies. Affordable Housing Fund Lump-sum Account (Draft Blueprint, Final Blueprint) Lump-sum accounts represent direct housing subsidies. Each county has a lump-sum account to hold all the available affordable housing funding for that county. BAUS assumes a constant annual funding amount (an independent input) , for each county during the plan period, doesn't consider inflation or fluctuations in funding availability over time. In each simulation iteration, funding available in each county's account equals the annual amount multiplies by years per iteration (5 years in BAUS) . Residential development projects that are not feasible under market conditions are potentially qualified for subsidy. Final Blueprint requires the projects to be also located within the Growth Geography. A qualified project draws money from the corresponding account to fill the feasibility gap. Not all qualified projects will be subsidized. Lum-sum accounts are scenario-based , having scenario-specific fund amount and project qualification criteria. Coding notes: Set up the account in policy.yaml Calculate each account's subsidy amount for each iteration and add it to coffer Set up the filter in run_subsidized_developer() Update the config in 'summaries.py' Check subsidized_residential_developer_lump_sum_accts() and make sure it is included in the model list in baus.py VMT Fees / Transportation Impact Fees (Draft Blueprint) Apply fees on new commercial or residential development that reflects transportation impacts associated with such development, focusing primarily on new commercial spaces or residential units anticipated to have high employment-related or residence-related vehicle miles traveled (VMT). The fees could be set at county, jurisdiction, or TAZ level, usually on a $/sqft basis for commercial development and $/unit basis for residential development. Draft Blueprint applies VMT on new office development based on the county and associated VMT per worker associated with the TAZ to incentivize development inside low-VMT job centers. This diagram illustrates the modeling steps in BAUS: BAUS has three types of VMT fees - \"com_for_res\" (apply fees on commercial development to subsidize residential development), \"res_for_res\" (apply fees on residential development to subsidize residential development), and \"com_for_com\" (apply fees on commercial development to subsidize commercial development). Each parcel is assigned a \"vmt_res_cat\" value and a \"vmt_nonres_cat\" value based on its categorized VMT-level. This is then mapped to the fee table to decide the fee amount for new residential and commercial development on the parcel. During each model iteration period (currently five years), VMT fees collected from new development go into one of the two accounts - \"vmt_res_acct\" and \"vmt_com_acct\" - for each geography (regional or sub-regional). Policies that aim to support/incentivize certain types of housing development or commercial activities can draw funding from respective account. In Draft Blueprint , VMT fees revenue is not applied into any job/housing incentive, but is accumulated to help to understand how much revenue is raised to support other economy strategies. Jobs-housing Balance Fee (Draft Blueprint) Apply a regional jobs-housing linkage fee to generate funding for affordable housing when new office development occurs in job-rich places, thereby incentivizing more jobs to locate in housing-rich places. The $/sqft fee assigned to each jurisdiction is a composite fee based on the jobs-housing ratio and jobs-housing fit for both cities and counties. Modeling jobs-housing fee in BAUS: Jobs-housing fee is tracked in BAUS under the \"jobs_housing_com_for_res\" account at the county level , which is similar to the \"com_for_res\" account of the VMT strategy. In each model interation period, jobs-housing fees applies to new office development in each county based on the $/sqft level of jurisdiction where the development occurs. The fees collected goes to each county's account. The account then acts similarly to the county-level lump-sum account to subsidize affordable housing in that county. Office Lump Sum Account (Final Blueprint) Similar to the residential funding lump sum account, office lump sum account provides funding to subsidize office development in targeted areas.","title":"PBA50"},{"location":"pba50/#plan-bay-area-2050","text":"Background: Plan Bay Area 2050 project website","title":"Plan Bay Area 2050"},{"location":"pba50/#scenarios","text":"","title":"Scenarios"},{"location":"pba50/#s21-blueprint-basic","text":"This is the \"base\" scenario in the sense that we are doing it first and the others build off of it Uses s21 control total files Uses Blueprint Basic logsums Uses s21 zoning modifications: major upzoning in all growth geogs Has almost all strategies in","title":"S21: Blueprint Basic"},{"location":"pba50/#s20-baseline-for-pba50","text":"This is the \"baseline\" scenario in the sense that it doesn't have any pba50 changes and so it also has far lower control totals Uses s20 control total files (these are minus the additional units built bc of housing policy in pba50) Uses Baseline logsums (somewhat less congestion than others?)
