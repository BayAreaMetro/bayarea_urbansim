This is a detailed geodatabase containing all of the region\u2019s buildings, households, employees, policies, and transport network for a recent year. This roughly corresponds to tooday\u2019s conditions but is a few years in the past due to data collection lag and formalities related to the modeling framework. The buildings are largely an accurate collection of every structure gathered from assessor\u2019s data, commercial read estate databases, and other sources. The households and employees are represented at the micro level but their characteristics are built through synthesis (i.e., we only have samples of this informations so we build a full representation that is consistent with these samples). Policies such as zoning and growth limits are collected for each jurisdiction and are binding unless they are explicitly changed for a forecast.</p> <p>BAUS is used to forecast the future by advancing through repeated steps that chart out a potential pathway for future urban growth. In BAUS each step represents a five year period. Most steps repeat the same set of sub-steps. In UrbanSim, each of these sub-steps is called a \u201cmodel\u201d. The file used to run BAUS (baus.py) sets the number steps and the order in which the models are are run. The major types of model steps are:</p> <ul> <li>(Hazards): This optional model simulates the impact of earthquakes and sea level rise by destroying buildings and displacing their inhabitants.</li> <li>Calculate accessibility: Logsum accessibility measures are brought in from the Travel Model and pedestrian accessibility is calculated within UrbanSim</li> <li>Calculate housing prices and rents: Hedonic regression models are applied to current (to the model time step) conditions to reestimate current prices and rents</li> <li>HH/employee relcation and transition: Some households and employeees are selected to move; additiional households and employees are added or subtracted to reflect the exogenous control totals</li> <li>Add buildings from the Development Projects list: Buildings are forced into the model (as opposed to being explicitly modeled); these represent institutional plans (e.g., universities and hospitals), large approved projects (e.g., Treasure Island), and development that has occurred between the basemap year and the current year (i.e., constructed 2016-2020).</li> <li>Build new market-rate housing units and commercial space: The for-profit real estate development process is simulated and new buildings are built where they are most feasible; this also build deed-restricted unit that are produced through the market-rate process (e.g., inclusionary zoning).</li> <li>Build new deed-restricted affordable units: A similar not-for-profit real estate development process produces affordable housing units based on money available within BAUS Accounts (e.g., bond measures). HH/employee location choices: Households and employees are assigned to new locations based on logistic regresssion models that capture the preferences of particular segments (e.g., lower income households, retail jobs).</li> <li>Produce summary tables: Numerous zonal summaries of the detailed geodatabaase are produced for analysis of urban change and for use in the Travel Model; this step includes additional post-processing to get the data ready for the Travel Model\u2019s population synthesizer.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"model_overview/#sub-models","title":"Sub-Models","text":"<p>Typically, a set of BAUS inputs or assumptions are modified to produce a scenario.
