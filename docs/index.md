# Bay Area UrbanSim (BAUS)


## Introduction

Bay Area UrbanSim (BAUS) is a land use or urban economic model used to forecast metropolitan growth, study urban policies, and evaluate transportation projects at the Metropolitan Transportation Commission (MTC). It is written in Python and is a customized version of the popular UrbanSim model developed by Professor Paul Waddell over the last few decades. BAUS simulates the movement of households and employees within the region, and the construction of new buildings to hold those households and employees. In this manner, it is used to incrementally forecast potential future urban growth trajectories.
