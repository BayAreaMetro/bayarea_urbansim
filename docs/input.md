# Inputs


## Regional and Sub-regional Forecast

The regional forecast contains infromation on the regionâ€™s overall growth trajectory. These tables contain only one value per variable per forecast for the entire region. They are generated by the REMI model and various scripts. The first two tables are standard for all UrbanSim applications, while the third contains a variety of data that is combined with other information using scripts within BAUS in order to produce required inputs to the Travel Model:

* Household Control Totals: This table represents the total number of households forecast to live in the Bay Area in each forecast year. This means BAUS will ensure that its forecast conforms to these numbers. The values area counts of households. The values are segmented into 5-year intervals (2010 to 2050) and into four categories of approximate household income quartiles.
* Employment Control Totals: This table represents the total number of jobs forecast to exist in the Bay Area in each forecast year. This means BAUS will ensure that its forecast conforms to these numbers. The values area counts of jobs. The values are segmented into each 5-year intervals (2010 to 2050) and into six sectors.
* Additional Regional Control Totals: This table provides additional forecast information that is passed on to the Travel Model.
